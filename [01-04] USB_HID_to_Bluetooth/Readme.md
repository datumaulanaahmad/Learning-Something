I think i gonna make a device for "bluetoothifying" any keyboard or mouse.
The principle is just simple, first programming microcontroller for reading ASCII code, then transmit it through bluetooth into any device.


the challenge, for me, is the part of selecting component. I genuinely should select the right component in some aspect, like selecting the right MCU, powersource, Bluetooth module, etc.


After some research, I found that stm32 both bluepill and blackpill, supported an USB 2.0 protocol. That's great because stm32 blackpill and bluepill is pretty cheap. Atfer that, selecting the right bluetooth
module is just quite simple, did'nt doing a big effort for selecting the right ones.

And . . . foila! I hope you guys waiting e for the next update
